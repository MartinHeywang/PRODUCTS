# PRODUCTS.
PRODUCTS. is a management game where you build assembly lines to become wealthy. Coming soon !

## Presentation
PRODUCTS. is a desktop only game (available soon on Windows, Linux, probably Mac OSX) where you build assembly lines to become richer and richer. Then, you'll create more assembly lines to earn even more money and unlock new content to make the game not boring at all !

## Contributions
I'm actually too young to accept donations... But don't worry:
If you wanna contribute to the game, once it's open, you will able to create your own images, and devices that you can create easily with the API.
If you don't know how to code (or in other languages) : don't worry, ideas are always welcome.

There are two ways of sending me ideas:
1. Open an issue with the appropriate label,
2. or Send me an email at 'martin.heywang1@gmail.com' (if you want some privation or don't have a github account).


But pay attention to : 
<li>a plugin must be free,</li>
<li>it can be yours or you can distribute it to anyone,</li>
<li>it musn't add pubs (I don't want you to make a profit of it),</li>
<li>it may be small as it can be large</li>
<li>a plugin just adds features to the game, but has limitations.</li>
<li>if a new version is released, it not work anymore. An adaptation will be required.</li>

But if you don't have any ideas, or anything like that... be one of the first stargazers (star, watch, fork...) ! 
I would really appreciate those things ! No. REALLY ! That helps me understand who has seen this.


## Details
Using the Java programming language with JavaFX. I am also using [PF4J][1] as a plugin system and [ORMLite][2] to manage the database.
I've been inspired by the mobile game [Assembly line][3].
I used [Pixilart][4] to make most of the images.

## Future
I've already a lot of ideas to make this game even better :
Here are some:
1. Create an *intelligent* loader that auto-detects assembly lines,
2. Add devices (splitters, sorters, ...)
3. Add a soundtrack (may need help for this...)
4. ...
	
I will create a website (probably using Github Pages) to make more docs about the game. I think that if you're currently reading, if you're on Github, you can only be a devloper... It would be much more accessible to make a website.

## About the creator
Hi! Nice to meet you!
My name is Martin Heywang and I'm too young too write how old I am in public. I live in France. (shortest description ever)
If you wanna know more about me, I'll create a discord server to chat about the game.
